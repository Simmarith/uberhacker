# uberhacker
a multiplayer hacking game which makes you look like all those stupid hackers on tv (except for mr. robot!)

## Usage
When it's finished, you just have to spin up the server and then connect to a "gameroom" via hostname/"gameroom"-name (I really want a better name for this ^^Â°)
After the game has been started by the server, you will get challenges via new windows popping up which you have to solve the fastest to get the point. Lobbys will probably have some kind of goal. Im thinking about
- a co-op mode in which you have to get to a certain value in points as fast as possible
- another co-op where you'll get an insane amount of challenges which will 'explode' in 5 seconds and
- a competitive mode where you have to reach a certain value in points first to win.

## Server
The server is currently just serving up webpages. Later in the process, he's gonna create as much "gamerooms" as you want upon request. He runs on node.js, so he needs that on your server to function.
